# Signaturit - Hiring - Lobby Wars

## Description
We are in the era of "lawsuits", everyone wants to go to court with their lawyer Saul and try to get a lot of dollars as if they were raining over
Manhattan.

The laws have changed much lately and governments have been digitized. That's when Signaturit comes into play.
The city council through the use of Signaturit maintains a registry of legal signatures of each party involved in the contracts that are made.
During a trial, justice only verifies the signatures of the parties involved in the contract to decide who wins. For that, they assign points to the
different signatures depending on the role of who signed.

For example, if the plaintiff has a contract that is signed by a notary he gets 2 points, if the defendant has in the contract the signature of only a 
validator he gets only 1 point, so the plaintiff party wins the trial.

## Roles
* King		(K): 5 points.
* Notary		(N): 2 points.
* Validator	(V): 1 point.

### Keep in mind that when a King signs, the signatures of the validators on his part have no value.

## 1 - First phase
We want you to automate this process, given a contract with your 2 parties involved and their signatures, and indicate which one wins the test.
###
- Make a program that receives both contracts as input (for example KN vs NNV ) and gives the winner as output. 
- We should be able to interact from console or HTTP.


## 2 - Second stage
Sometimes the contract does not have all the signs, so we represent it using the #character. Taking into account that only one signature per part
can be empty to be valid, determine which is the minimum signature necessary to win the trial given a contract with the signatures of the known
opposition party.
For example, given N#V vs NVV should return N.
###
- Make a program that receives both contracts as input (for example N#V vs NVV ) and gives the signature required to win as output.
- We should be able to interact from console or HTTP.

## What we would like to find (although not mandatory):
- Best practices as Clean Code, SOLID, Unit testing.
- Usage of DDD and Hexagonal Architecture.
- Apply Command and Query
- zip with a git repository so we see how you structure your commits.
